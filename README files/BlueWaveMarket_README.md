# Seafood Marketplace

Monorepo for a small Seafood Marketplace application with separate `backend/` and `frontend/` folders.

This repository contains:

- `backend/` — Express/Node API, controllers, models, and file uploads
- `frontend/` — React + Vite single-page application

## Quick Overview

- Backend runs on Node/Express and exposes REST endpoints used by the frontend.
- Frontend is built with Vite and serves the UI; it talks to the backend via `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

## Setup (both parts)

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 16+ (LTS recommended)
- npm or yarn

Start the backend (example):

```powershell
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Start the frontend:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Environment variables

- Backend: create `.env` inside `backend/` for DB connection, secret keys, etc. Do NOT commit `.env` files.
- Frontend: use `.env` in `frontend/` and expose client variables with `VITE_` prefix (for example `VITE_API_BASE_URL`).

## Important files and folders

- `backend/uploads/` — user-uploaded files (ignored in git)
- `frontend/src/` — React source code
- `frontend/README.md` — frontend-specific README

## Git / .gitignore notes

Common generated items are ignored (for example `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `backend/uploads/`). If large folders are already tracked, remove them from the index with:

```powershell
git rm -r --cached node_modules
git rm -r --cached backend/uploads
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Stop tracking generated files and add .gitignore"
```

## Contributing

- Create a feature branch `feature/your-feature`
- Keep commits small; write clear PR descriptions
- Run linters and tests before opening a PR

## Next suggestions

- Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` with contribution rules
- Add a `LICENSE` file
- Add CI (GitHub Actions) to run tests and lint on PRs

## Development workflow

Follow these practices to keep the repository healthy and reviewable:

- Branches: `main` for releases; feature branches named `feature/<short-desc>`; hotfix branches `hotfix/<short-desc>`.
- Commit messages: follow Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat(auth): add JWT login`).
- Pull Requests: open PRs against `main` with a clear description, test instructions, and list of changed files.
- CI: add tests and linters to run on PRs (suggest GitHub Actions).

# Seafood Marketplace — Frontend

A modern React + Vite frontend for the Seafood Marketplace application.

This README documents how to set up, run, build, and contribute to the frontend portion of the project.

## Key Features

- Vite + React for fast development and HMR
- Centralized state management (see `src/store/store.js`)
- Components for cart, authentication, payments, and admin pages

## Tech Stack

- React (JSX) with Vite
- Fetch / REST API client to the backend server
- ESLint for linting

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ (LTS recommended)
- npm or yarn

## Quick Start (development)

Open a terminal and run:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be served by Vite (usually at `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build for Production

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The built files will be emitted to the `dist/` directory. Serve them with a static host or integrate with your backend.

## Environment Variables

If the frontend expects environment variables, add them to a `.env` file in `frontend/` (do NOT commit `.env` files). Example:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Vite exposes variables prefixed with `VITE_` to the client.

## Project Structure (important files)

- `src/` — React sources
	- `components/` — shared UI components (Cart, Navbar, Login, etc.)
	- `pages/` — route-level pages (Home, AdminDashboard, Checkout)
	- `store/` — Redux / Zustand / custom store setup
- `public/` — static assets
- `vite.config.js` — Vite config

## Common Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run preview` — preview production build locally (if configured)

## Linting & Formatting

If ESLint and/or Prettier are configured, run:

```powershell
npm run lint
npm run format
```

Adjust commands to `yarn` if you prefer.

## Connecting to Backend

The frontend makes API calls to the backend server located in `../backend`. Ensure the backend is running and `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (or equivalent) points to the backend address.

## Contributing

- Fork the repo and open a branch per feature: `feature/<short-description>`
- Keep commits small and focused
- Open a pull request with a clear description and testing instructions

## Troubleshooting

- Port conflicts: change Vite port with `--port` or in `vite.config.js`
- CORS errors: enable CORS in backend during development or proxy requests
